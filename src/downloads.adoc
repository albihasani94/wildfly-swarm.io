=== Generally Speaking

For the most part, WildFly Swarm is consumed through
Maven artifacts, resembling `pom.xml` entries such as

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>jaxrs</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

We highly recommend using one of our BOMs so that you don't
need to specify versions of each component you bring in:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>bom<artifactId>
      <version>${version.wildfly-swarm}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

For more information, please see _How to use a BOM_ in the link:http://docs.wildfly-swarm.io/[documentation].

=== Directly Downloadable

We do provide a few directly downloadable and usable items:

==== SwarmTool

SwarmTool can be used to take an existing `.war` and "swarmify" it.

==== MicroProfile Server

Our MicroProfile server can be used to run an existing MicroProfile-compliant
`.war` file.

==== MicroProfile + JPA Server

Our MicroProfile with JPA server can be used to run MicroProfile microservices that require JPA that
are present in a `war` file.

==== Web Server

Similar to the MicroProfile server,
Web provides a Hollow jar that's equivalent to the Web Profile from Java EE.
